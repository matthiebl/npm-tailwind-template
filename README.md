# @matthiebl/npm-tailwind-template

This is a simple template repo for making an npm module with react + typescript + tailwind

## Setup

This is the folder structure we set up for you:

```txt
/src
  index.tsx       # This is where all built exports will be available from
  /stories        # Where stories for storybook are located
    ...
/test             # Where tests are located
  ...
.gitignore
package.json
README.md         # EDIT THIS
tsconfig.json
```

You will need to rename the `name` of the package in the `package.json`. I recommend find and replace `npm-tailwind-template` with `<your package name>`. Ensure the author, license, homepage, bugs, and repository are all correct as well.
